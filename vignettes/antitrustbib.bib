  Abstract                 = {This paper develops techniques for empirically analyzing demand and supply in differentiated products markets and then applies these techniques to analyze equilibrium in the U.S. automobile industry. Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

  Abstract                 = {We evaluate the sources of transitory market power in personal computers in the late 1980s to explain how high rates of imitative entry coexisted with high rates of innovative investment. We measure the impact of different principles of differentiation (PDs); each PD reflects a distinct notion of product similarity, offering a potential source of market segmentation. One PD measures the substitutability between frontier and nonfrontier products, while a second PD measures the advantage afforded by a brand-name reputation. We find segmentation along both dimensions, which meant that the effects of competitive events (such as entry) were localized. A high rate of entry was consistent with slow erosion of incumbent rents.},

While the approach can be generalized, we develop these ideas within a particular framework - the PCAIDS (proportionality-calibrated AIDS) model. We show that the brand-level margins effectively define product "nests" (products that are especially close substitutes) and substantially increase the flexibility of PCAIDS for modeling critical own- and cross-price elasticities. The model is particularly valuable for transactions at the wholesale level (where scanner data do not exist) and for geographic markets that span national borders (where comparable data may not be available), since other methods to derive elasticities, particularly those based on econometric estimation, may not be possible or may not be reliable. },

  Abstract                 = {The ready-to-eat cereal industry is characterized by high concentration, high price-cost margins, large advertising-to-sales ratios, and numerous introductions of new products. Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a stochastic algorithm for computing symmetric Markov perfect equilibria. The algorithm computes equilibrium policy and value functions, and generates a transition kernel for the (stochastic) evolution of the state of the system. It has two features that together imply that it need not be subject to the curse of dimensionality. First, the integral that determines continuation values is never calculated; rather it is approximated by a simple average of returns from past outcomes of the algorithm, an approximation whose computational burden is not tied to the dimension of the state space. Second, iterations of the algorithm update value and policy functions at a single (rather than at all possible) points in the state space. Random draws from a distribution set by the updated policies determine the location of the next iteration's updates. This selection only repeatedly hits the recurrent class of points, a subset whose cardinality is not directly tied to that of the state space. Numerical results for industrial organization problems show that our algorithm can increase speed and decrease memory requirements by several orders of magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {The consequences of a horizontal merger are typically studied by treating the merger as an exogenous change in market structure that displaces the initial Cournot equilibrium. In the new equilibrium the merged firm is assumed to behave like a multiplant Cournot player engaged in a noncooperative game against other sellers. The purpose of this article is to evaluate an unnoticed comparative-static implication of this approach: some exogenous mergers may reduce the endogenous joint profits of the firms that are assumed to collude. Cournot's original example is used to illustrate this and other bizarre results that can occur in the Cournot framework if the market structure is treated as exogenous.},

  Abstract                 = { Using the logit model, and assuming Nash equilibrium in prices and constant marginal cost, it is straightforward to estimate critical demand parameters and simulate mergers. In this way, the logit model can be used to predict the price and welfare effects of mergers. We explore the effects of mergers in this model both analytically and through simulations of hypothetical mergers of U.S. long distance carriers. We find that only mergers involving AT\&T would be likely to lessen welfare significantly. Simulations such as these provide a firmer foundation for antitrust policy than traditional structural indicators. The logit model is not always appropriate, but the basic methodology can be adapted to other demand systems. Copyright 1994 by Oxford University Press.},
