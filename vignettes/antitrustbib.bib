	estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic
	differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained
	using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level
	data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium
	in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed
	here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters
	for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

	high price-cost margins, large advertising-to-sales ratios, and numerous
	introductions of new products. Previous researchers have concluded
	that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an
	industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice
	competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In
	particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I
	am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources:
	(i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which
	is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential
	price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different
	brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed
	price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent
	with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins.
	Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated
	products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these
	two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

	evolution of the state of the system. It has two features that together
	imply that it need not be subject to the curse of dimensionality.
	First, the integral that determines continuation values is never
	calculated; rather it is approximated by a simple average of returns
	from past outcomes of the algorithm, an approximation whose computational
	burden is not tied to the dimension of the state space. Second, iterations
	of the algorithm update value and policy functions at a single (rather
	than at all possible) points in the state space. Random draws from
	a distribution set by the updated policies determine the location
	of the next iteration's updates. This selection only repeatedly hits
	the recurrent class of points, a subset whose cardinality is not
	directly tied to that of the state space. Numerical results for industrial
	organization problems show that our algorithm can increase speed
	and decrease memory requirements by several orders of magnitude.},

	defined by their capacities. The expected market share of each supplier
	is the ratio of its capacity to the industry capacity. The buyer's
	optimal reserve price declines with increases in the concentration
	of the industry. The lower reserve price can partially or fully offset
	the price effects of a merger. However, a merger always reduces the
	buyer's welfare. The lower reserve price can also undermine the incentive
	for larger suppliers to merge and result in stable industry structures
	for which no further mergers would be profitable.},

	functional form for industry demand, and any assumption is vulnerable
	to attack. This paper demonstrates that marginal cost reductions

  abstract = { Using the logit model, and assuming Nash equilibrium in prices and
	constant marginal cost, it is straightforward to estimate critical
	demand parameters and simulate mergers. In this way, the logit model
	can be used to predict the price and welfare effects of mergers.
	We explore the effects of mergers in this model both analytically
	and through simulations of hypothetical mergers of U.S. long distance
	carriers. We find that only mergers involving AT\&T would be likely
	to lessen welfare significantly. Simulations such as these provide
	a firmer foundation for antitrust policy than traditional structural
	indicators. The logit model is not always appropriate, but the basic
	methodology can be adapted to other demand systems. Copyright 1994
