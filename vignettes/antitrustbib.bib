	Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain
	estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic
	differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained
	using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level
	data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium
	in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed
	here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters

	high price-cost margins, large advertising-to-sales ratios, and numerous
	introductions of new products. Previous researchers have concluded
	that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an
	industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice
	competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In
	particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I
	am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources:
	(i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which
	is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential
	price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different
	brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed
	price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent
	with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins.
	Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated
	products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these
	two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

	and value functions, and generates a transition kernel for the (stochastic)
	evolution of the state of the system. It has two features that together
	imply that it need not be subject to the curse of dimensionality.
	First, the integral that determines continuation values is never
	calculated; rather it is approximated by a simple average of returns
	from past outcomes of the algorithm, an approximation whose computational
	burden is not tied to the dimension of the state space. Second, iterations
	of the algorithm update value and policy functions at a single (rather
	than at all possible) points in the state space. Random draws from
	a distribution set by the updated policies determine the location
	of the next iteration's updates. This selection only repeatedly hits
	the recurrent class of points, a subset whose cardinality is not
	directly tied to that of the state space. Numerical results for industrial
	organization problems show that our algorithm can increase speed
	and decrease memory requirements by several orders of magnitude.},
