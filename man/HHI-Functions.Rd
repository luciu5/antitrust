\usage{
HHI(shares, owner = diag(length(shares)), control)
}
\arguments{
\item{shares}{A length-k vector of product quantity shares.}

\item{owner}{EITHER a vector  of length k whose values
indicate which of the merging parties produced a product OR
a k x k matrix of ownership shares. Default is a diagonal matrix,
which assumes that each product is owned by a separate firm.}

\item{control}{EITHER a vector  of length k whose values
indicate which of the merging parties have the ability to make pricing
or output decisions OR a k x k matrix of
control shares. Default is a k x k matrix equal to 1 if \sQuote{owner} > 0
and 0 otherwise.}
}
\value{
\code{HHI} returns a number between 0 and 10,000
}
\description{
Calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index with arbitrary
ownership and control.

Let k denote the number of products produced by the merging parties below.
}
\details{
All \sQuote{shares} must be between 0 and 1. When \sQuote{owner} is a matrix,
the i,jth element of \sQuote{owner} should equal the percentage of
product j's profits earned by the owner
of product i. When \sQuote{owner} is a vector, \code{HHI} generates a k x k
matrix of whose i,jth element equals 1 if products i and j are
commonly owned and 0 otherwise. \sQuote{control} works in a fashion similar
to \sQuote{owner}.
}
\examples{
## Consider a market with 5 products labeled 1-5. 1,2 are produced
## by Firm A, 2,3 are produced by Firm B, 3 is produced by Firm C.
## The pre-merger product market shares are

shares = c(.15,.2,.25,.35,.05)
owner  = c("A","A","B","B","C")
nprod  = length(shares)

HHI(shares,owner)

## Suppose that Firm A acquires a 75\\% ownership stake in product 3, and
## Firm B get a 10\\% ownership stake in product 1. Assume that neither
## firm cedes control of the product to the other.

owner <- diag(nprod)

owner[1,2] <- owner[2,1] <- owner[3,4] <- owner[4,3] <- 1
control <- owner
owner[1,1] <- owner[2,1] <- .9
owner[3,1] <- owner[4,1] <- .1
owner[1,3] <- owner[2,3] <- .75
owner[3,3] <- owner[4,3] <- .25

HHI(shares,owner,control)

## Suppose now that in addition to the ownership stakes described
## earlier, B receives 30\\% of the control of product 1
control[1,1] <- control[2,1] <- .7
control[3,1] <- control[4,1] <- .3
