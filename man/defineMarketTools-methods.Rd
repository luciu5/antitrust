\arguments{
\item{object}{An instance of one of the classes listed above.}

\item{prodIndex}{A vector of product indices that are to be placed under the control of the Hypothetical Monopolist.}

\item{ssnip}{A number between 0 and 1 that equals the threshold for a \dQuote{Small but Significant and
Non-transitory Increase in Price} (SSNIP). Default is .05, or 5\%.}

\item{...}{Pass options to the optimizer used to solve for equilibrium prices.}

\item{plantIndex}{A vector of plant indices that are to be placed under the control of the Hypothetical Monopolist (Cournot).}
}
\value{
\code{HypoMonTest} returns TRUE if a profit-maximizing Hypothetical Monopolist who controls the products indexed by
\sQuote{prodIndex} would increase the price of at least one of the merging
parties' products in \sQuote{prodIndex} by a \sQuote{ssnip}, and
FALSE otherwise. \code{HypoMonTest} returns an error if \sQuote{prodIndex}
does not contain at least one of the merging parties products.

\code{calcPriceDeltaHypoMon} returns a vector of proportional price changes for
all products placed under the control of the Hypothetical
Monopolist (i.e. all products indexed by \sQuote{prodIndex}).

\code{calcPricesHypoMon} is identical, but for price levels.

\code{diversionHypoMon} returns a k x k matrix of diversions,
where element i,j is the diversion from product i to product j.

\description{
An Implementation of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test described in the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines.

\code{\link{HypoMonTest}} implements the Hypothetical Monopolist Test for a given \sQuote{ssnip}.

\code{calcPricesHypoMon} computes prices for a subset of firms under the control of a hypothetical monopolist
under the specified demand function or auction.

\code{\link{diversionHypoMon}} calculates the matrix of revenue diversions between all products included in the
merger simulation, \emph{irrespective of whether or not they are also included in \sQuote{prodIndex}}.

\code{\link{calcPriceDeltaHypoMon}} computes the proportional difference in product prices between the
prices of products in \sQuote{prodIndex} (i.e. prices set by the
Hypothetical Monopolist) and prices set in the pre-merger equilibrium.
\sQuote{...} may be used to pass arguments to the optimizer.

\details{
Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms playing the Bertrand pricing game above.

\code{HypoMonTest} is an implementation of the Hypothetical Monopolist Test
on the products indexed by \sQuote{prodIndex} for a \sQuote{ssnip}. The
Hypothetical Monopolist Test determines whether a profit-maximizing
Hypothetical Monopolist who controls the products indexed by
\sQuote{prodIndex} would increase the price of at least one of the merging parties' products in \sQuote{prodIndex} by a
small, significant, and non-transitory amount (i.e. impose a SSNIP).

\code{calcPriceDeltaHypoMon} calculates the price changes relative to (predicted) pre-merger prices that a
Hypothetical Monopolist would impose on the products indexed by \sQuote{prodIndex}, holding the prices of products not
controlled by the Hypothetical Monopolist fixed at pre-merger levels. With the exception of \sQuote{AIDS}, the
\code{calcPriceDeltaHypoMon} for all the classes listed above calls \code{calcPricesHypoMon} to compute price
levels. \code{calcPriceDeltaHypoMon} is in turn called by \code{HypoMonTest}.

\code{diversionHypoMon} calculates the matrix of revenue diversions between all products included in the merger simulation,
\emph{irrespective} of whether or not they are also included in
\sQuote{prodIndex}. This matrix is useful for diagnosing whether or not a
product not included in \sQuote{prodIndex} may have a higher revenue diversion
either to or from a product included in \sQuote{prodIndex}. Note that the \sQuote{AIDS}
\code{diversionHypoMon} method does not contain the \sQuote{prodIndex}
argument, as AIDS revenue diversions are only a function of demand parameters.
