\arguments{
\item{object}{An instance of the respective class (see description for the classes)}

\item{preMerger}{If TRUE, the pre-merger ownership structure is used. If FALSE, the post-merger ownership structure is used.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{exAnte}{If \sQuote{exAnte} equals TRUE then the
\emph{ex ante} expected result for each firm is produced, while FALSE produces the
expected result conditional on each firm winning the auction. Default is FALSE.}

\item{isMax}{If TRUE, a check is run to determine if the calculated equilibrium price vector locally maximizes profits.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{subset}{A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded. Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.}

\item{...}{For Logit, additional values that may be used to change the
default values of \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}}, the non-linear equation solver.

For others, additional values that may be used to change the default values of \code{\link{constrOptim}}, the non-linear
equation solver used to enforce non-negative equilibrium quantities.}

\description{
For Auction2ndCap, the calcPrices method computes the expected price that the buyer pays,
conditional on the buyer purchasing from a particular firm.

For Logit, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is Logit and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.

For LogitCap, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium shares under the assumptions that
consumer demand is Logit and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game with capacity constraints.

For Logit, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is Logit and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.

For LogLin, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is Log-Linear and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.

For AIDS, the calcPrices method computes either pre-merger or post-merger equilibrium prices under the assumptions
that consumer demand is AIDS and firms play a differentiated product Bertrand Nash pricing game.
It returns a length-k vector of NAs if the user did not supply prices.
