\arguments{
\item{demand}{A character vector indicating which demand system to use.
Currently allows logit (default), ces, or aids.}

\item{prices}{A length k vector product prices. Default is missing, in
which case demand intercepts are not calibrated.}

\item{quantities}{A length k vector of product quantities.}

\item{margins}{A length k vector of product margins. All margins must
be either be between 0 and 1, or NA.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product before the merger OR a
k x k matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{ownerPost}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product after the merger OR
a k x k matrix of post-merger ownership shares.}

\item{mktElast}{A negative number equal to the industry pre-merger
price elasticity. Default is NA.}

\item{insideSize}{Size of all units included in the market. For logit,
this defaults to total quantity, while for aids and ces
this defaults to total revenues.}

\item{diversions}{A k x k matrix of diversion ratios with diagonal
elements equal to -1. Default is missing, in which case diversion
according to revenue share is assumed.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length k where each element equals the
proportional change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}

\item{subset}{A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded. Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.}

\item{priceOutside}{A postive real number equal to the price of the outside good.
Default either equals 1 for Logit demand or 0 for CES demand.}

\item{priceStart}{A vector of length k who elements equal to an
initial guess of the proportional change in price caused by the
merger.  For aids, the default is to draw k random elements from
a [0,1] uniform distribution. For ces and logit, the default is prices.}

\item{isMax}{If TRUE, checks to see whether computed price equilibrium
locally maximizes firm profits and returns a warning if not. Default is FALSE.}

\item{parmStart}{\code{aids} only. A vector of length 2 who elements equal to an
initial guess for "known" element of the diagonal of the demand matrix and the market elasticity.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters passed
to the calibration routine optimizer (typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{control.equ}{A list of  \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} control parameters passed
to the non-linear equation solver (typically the \code{calcPrices} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels.}

\item{...}{Additional options to feed to the \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}}
optimizer used to solve for equilibrium prices.}
}
\value{
\code{bertrand.alm} returns an instance of class \code{\linkS4class{LogitALM}},
\code{\linkS4class{CESALM}}, or \code{\linkS4class{AIDS}},
depending upon the value of the ``demand'' argument.
}
\description{
Calibrates consumer demand using either a
Logit, CES, or AIDS demand system and then simulates the
prices effect of a merger between two firms
under the assumption that all firms in the market
are playing a Nash-Bertrand price setting game.

Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms below.
}
\details{
The main purpose of this function is to provide a more convenient front-end
for the \code{aids}, \code{logit.alm} and \code{ces} functions.

Using price, and quantity, information for all products
in each market, as well as margin information for at least
one products in each market, \code{bertrand.alm} is able to
recover the slopes and intercepts of either a Logit, CES, or AIDS demand
system. These parameters are then used to simulate the price
effects of a merger between
two firms under the assumption that the firms are playing a
simultaneous price setting game.


\sQuote{ownerPre} and \sQuote{ownerPost} values will typically be equal to either 0
(element [i,j] is not commonly owned) or 1 (element [i,j] is commonly
                                            owned), though these matrices may take on any value between 0 and 1 to
account for partial ownership.
