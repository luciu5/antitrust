\usage{
\S4method{diversion}{Bertrand}(object, preMerger = TRUE,
  revenue = FALSE)

\S4method{diversion}{AIDS}(object, preMerger = TRUE, revenue = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An instance of one of the classes listed above.}

\item{preMerger}{If TRUE, calculates pre-merger price elasticities. If
FALSE, calculates post-merger price elasticities. Default is TRUE.}

\item{revenue}{If TRUE, calculates revenue diversion. If
FALSE, calculates quantity diversion. Default is TRUE for \sQuote{Bertrand}
and FALSE for \sQuote{AIDS}.}
}
\value{
returns a k x k matrix of diversion ratios, where the i,jth
element is the diversion from i to j.
}
\description{
Calculate the diversion matrix between any two products in the market.

\details{
For Bertrand, when \sQuote{revenue} is FALSE (the default),
this method uses the results from the merger calibration and
simulation to compute the \emph{quantity} diversion matrix between any two products
in the market. Element i,j of this matrix is the quantity diversion from
product i to product j, or the
proportion of product i's sales that leave (go to) i for (from) j due
to a increase (decrease) in i's price. Mathematically, quantity diversion is
\eqn{\frac{-\epsilon_{ji}share_j}{\epsilon_{ii}share_i}},
where \eqn{\epsilon_{ij}} is the cross-price elasticity from i to j.

When \sQuote{revenue} is TRUE, this method computes the revenue diversion
matrix between any two products in the market. Element i,j of this matrix is the revenue diversion from
product i to product j, or the
proportion of product i's revenues that leave (go to) i for (from) j due
to a increase (decrease) in i's price. Mathematically, revenue diversion is
\eqn{-\frac{\epsilon_{ji}(\epsilon_{jj}-1)r_j}{\epsilon_{jj}(\epsilon_{ii}-1)r_j}}
where \eqn{r_i} is the revenue share of product i.

When \sQuote{preMerger} is TRUE, diversions are
calculated at pre-merger equilibrium prices, and when \sQuote{preMerger} is FALSE, they
are calculated at post-merger equilibrium prices.

For AIDS, when \sQuote{revenue} is TRUE (the default),
this method computes the \emph{revenue} diversion matrix between any two
products in the market. For AIDS, the revenue diversion from i to j is
\eqn{\frac{\beta_{ji}}{\beta_ij}}, where \eqn{\beta_{ij}} is the
percentage change in product i's revenue due to a change in j's price.

When \sQuote{revenue} is FALSE, this \code{callNextMethod} is invoked. Will
yield a matrix of NAs if the user did not supply prices.

When \sQuote{preMerger} is TRUE, diversions are
calculated at pre-merger equilibrium prices, and when \sQuote{preMerger} is FALSE, they
are calculated at post-merger equilibrium prices.
