\title{Class \dQuote{Auction}}
\description{
The \dQuote{Auction2ndCap} class contains all the information needed to
calibrate a 2nd price auction with capacity constraints

The \dQuote{Auction2ndLogit} class contains all the information needed to
calibrate a Logit
demand system and perform a merger simulation analysis under the assumption that
firms are setting offers in a 2nd-score auction.

The \dQuote{Auction2ndLogitNests} class contains all the information needed to
calibrate a Nested Logit
demand system and perform a merger simulation analysis under the assumption that
firms are setting offers in a 2nd-score auction.

The \dQuote{Auction2ndLogitALM} class contains all the information needed to
calibrate a Logit
demand system with unobserved outside share and perform a merger simulation analysis under the assumption that
firms are setting offers in a 2nd-score auction.

Below, let k denote the number of firms.
