\arguments{
\item{prices}{A length k vector of product prices.}

\item{shares}{A length k vector of product (quantity) shares. Values must be
between 0 and 1.}

\item{margins}{A length k vector of product margins (in levels, not percents), some of which may
equal NA.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product pre-merger OR
a k x k matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{ownerPost}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product after the merger OR
a k x k matrix of post-merger ownership shares.}

\item{bargpowerPre}{A length k vector of pre-merger bargaining power parameters. Values
must be between 0 (sellers have the power) and 1 (buyers the power). NA values are allowed,
though must be calibrated from additional margin and share data. Default is 0.5.}

\item{bargpowerPost}{A length k vector of post-merger bargaining power parameters. Values
must be between 0 (sellers have the power) and 1 (buyers the power). NA values are allowed,
though must be calibrated from additional margin and share data. Default is \sQuote{bargpowerPre}.}

\item{output}{a length 1 logical vector equal to TRUE if merger simulation performed
on output market, FALSE if simulation performed on input market. Default TRUE.}

\item{normIndex}{An integer equalling the index (position) of the
inside product whose mean valuation will be normalized to 1. Default
is 1, unless \sQuote{shares} sum to less than 1, in which case the default is
NA and an outside good is assumed to exist.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length k where each element equals the
(level) change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}

\item{subset}{A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded.Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.}

\item{priceStart}{A vector of length k who elements equal to an
initial guess of equilibrium prices. default is \sQuote{prices}.}

\item{insideSize}{An integer equal to total pre-merger units sold.
If shares sum to one, this also equals the size of the market.}

\item{priceOutside}{A positive real number equal to the price of the outside good.
Default equals 0 for Logit demand.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters passed
to the calibration routine optimizer (typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{control.equ}{A list of  \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} control parameters passed
to the non-linear equation solver (typically the \code{calcPrices} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels. Default is "Prod#", where
\sQuote{#} is a number between 1 and the length of \sQuote{prices}.}

\item{mcDeltaOutside}{A length 1 vector indicating the change in the marginal cost of the
outside good. Default is 0.}

\description{
Calibrates consumer demand using  Logit and then
simulates the price effect of a merger between two firms
under the assumption that firms and customers in the market are playing a
differentiated products Nash Bargaining game.

Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms playing the
Nash Bargaining game below.
}
\details{
Using product prices, quantity shares and all of the
product margins from at least one firm, \code{auction2nd.logit} is able to
recover the price coefficient and product mean valuations in a
Logit demand model. \code{auction2nd.logit} then uses these
calibrated parameters to simulate a merger between two firms, under the assumption that firms are participating in a A Nash Bargaining Game 
(bargaining.logit) or splitting the full surplus (bargaining2nd.logit).
