\arguments{
\item{prices}{A length k vector product prices.}

\item{quantities}{A length k vector of product quantities.}

\item{margins}{A length k vector of product margins. All margins must
be either be between 0 and 1, or NA.}

\item{diversions}{A k x k matrix of diversion ratios with diagonal
elements equal to -1. Default is missing, in which case diversion
according to quantity share is assumed.}

\item{symmetry}{If TRUE, requires the matrix of demand slope coefficients
to be symmetric and homogeneous of degree 0 in prices, both of which
suffice to make demand consistent with utility maximization theory.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product pre-merger OR
a k x k matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{ownerPost}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product after the merger OR
a k x k matrix of post-merger ownership shares.}

\item{mcDelta}{A length k vector where each element equals the
proportional change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}

\item{subset}{A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded.Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.}

\item{priceStart}{A length k vector of prices used as the initial guess
in the nonlinear equation solver. Default is \sQuote{prices}.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters
passed to the calibration routine optimizer (typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels. Default is "Prod#", where
\sQuote{#} is a number between 1 and the length of \sQuote{prices}.}

\item{...}{Additional options to feed to the solver. See below.}

\item{control.equ}{A list of  \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} control parameters
passed to the non-linear equation solver (typically the \code{calcPrices} method).}

\description{
Calibrates consumer demand using either a
linear or log-linear demand system and then simulates
the prices effect of a merger between two firms
under the assumption that all firms in the market
are playing a differentiated products Bertrand game.

Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms.
}
\details{
Using price, quantity, and diversion information for all products
in a market, as well as margin information for (at least) all the
products of any firm, \code{linear} is able to
recover the slopes and intercepts in a Linear demand
system and then uses these demand parameters to simulate the price
effects of a merger between
two firms under the assumption that the firms are playing a
differentiated Bertrand pricing game.

\code{loglinear} uses the same information as \code{linear} to uncover the
slopes and intercepts in a Log-Linear demand system, and then uses these
demand parameters to simulate the price effects of a merger of two firms under the
assumption that the firms are playing a
differentiated Bertrand pricing game.


\sQuote{diversions} must be a square matrix whose off-diagonal elements [i,j] estimate the diversion ratio from product i to product j
(i.e. the estimated fraction of i's sales that go to j due to a small
  increase in i's price). Off-diagonal elements are restricted to be
non-negative (products are assumed to be substitutes), diagonal elements
must equal -1, and rows must sum to 0 (negative if you wish to include an outside good) . If \sQuote{diversions} is missing, then diversion according to quantity share is assumed.



\sQuote{ownerPre} and \sQuote{ownerPost} values will typically be equal to either 0
(element [i,j] is not commonly owned) or 1 (element [i,j] is commonly
                                            owned), though these matrices may take on any value between 0 and 1 to
account for partial ownership.


Under linear demand, an analytic solution to the Bertrand pricing game
exists. However, this solution can at times produce negative
equilibrium quantities. To accommodate this issue, \code{linear}
uses \code{\link{constrOptim}}  to
find equilibrium prices with non-negative quantities. \code{...} may
be used to change the default options for \link{constrOptim}.

\code{loglinear} uses the non-linear equation solver
\code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} to find equilibrium prices.  \code{...} may
be used to change the default options for \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}}.
