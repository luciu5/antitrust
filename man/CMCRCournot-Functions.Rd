}
\arguments{
\item{shares}{A length-2 vector containing merging party quantity shares.}

\item{mktElast}{A length-1 containing the industry elasticity.}

\item{party}{If TRUE calculate a length-2 vector of individial party CMCRs. 
If FALSE calculate share-weighted CMCR relative to share-weighted pre-merger
marginal costs. Default is FALSE}

\item{rel}{A length 1 character vector indicating whether CMCR should be calculated
relative to pre-merger cost (``cost'') or pre-merger price (``price''), 
Default is ``cost''.}

\item{labels}{A length-2 vector of product labels.}

\item{margins}{A length-2 vector of product margins.}

\item{prices}{A length-2 vector of product prices.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length 2 whose values
indicate which of the merging parties produced a product pre-merger OR
a 2 x 2 matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{ownerPost}{A 2 x 2 matrix of post-merger
ownership shares. Default is a 2 x 2 matrix of 1s.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length 2 where each element equals the
proportional change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}
}
\value{
when \sQuote{party} is FALSE (default), \code{cmcr.cournot}, \code{cmcr.cournot2} return a vector with 1 element whose value equals the percentage change
in the products' average marginal costs that the merged firms
must achieve in order to offset a price increase. When \sQuote{party} is TRUE,  \code{cmcr.cournot}, \code{cmcr.cournot2} return a vector with 2 element whose value equals the percentage change
in \emph{each} parties' marginal costs necessary to offset a price increase. When \sQuote{rel} equals "cost" (default) results are in terms of per-merger marginal costs. Otherwise, results are in terms of pre-merger price.
}
\description{
Calculate the marginal cost reductions necessary to restore
premerger prices (CMCR), or the net Upwards Pricing Pressure (UPP) in a
merger involving firms playing a 
homogeneous product Cournot pricing game.
}
\details{
The \sQuote{shares} (or \sQuote{margins}) vector must have 2 elements, 
and all \sQuote{shares} and \sQuote{margins}
elements must be between 0 and 1. The \sQuote{mktElast} vector must
have 1 non-negative  element.

##  calculate average CMCR as a percentage of pre-merger costs
cmcr.cournot(shares,industryElast, rel="cost")

##  calculate average CMCR as a percentage of pre-merger price
cmcr.cournot(shares,industryElast, rel="price")

##  calculate average CMCR using margins as a percentage of pre-merger costs
cmcr.cournot2(margins, party=TRUE,rel="cost")

##  calculate the average CMCR for various shares and
##  industry elasticities in a two-product merger where both firm
##  products have identical share (see Froeb and
##  Werden, 1998, pg. 369, Table 1)



deltaHHI = c(100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000) #start with change in HHI

industryElast = 1:3

result = matrix(nrow=length(deltaHHI),ncol=length(industryElast),
                dimnames=list(deltaHHI,industryElast))
