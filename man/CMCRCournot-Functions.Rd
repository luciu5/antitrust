\title{Compensating Marginal Cost Reductions and Upwards Pricing Pressure (Cournot)}
\usage{
cmcr.cournot(shares, mktElast)

upp.cournot(prices, margins, ownerPre, ownerPost = matrix(1, ncol =
  length(prices), nrow = length(prices)), mcDelta = rep(0, length(prices)),
  labels = paste("Prod", 1:length(prices), sep = ""))
}
\arguments{
\item{shares}{A length-2 vector containing merging party quantity shares.}

\item{mktElast}{A length-1 containing the industry elasticity.}

\item{prices}{A length-2 vector of product prices.}

\item{margins}{A length-2 vector of product margins.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length 2 whose values
indicate which of the merging parties produced a product pre-merger OR
a 2 x 2 matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{ownerPost}{A 2 x 2 matrix of post-merger
ownership shares. Default is a 2 x 2 matrix of 1s.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length 2 where each element equals the
proportional change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}

\item{labels}{A length-2 vector of product labels.}
}
\value{
A vector with 1 element whose value equals the percentage change
in the products' average marginal costs that the merged firms
must achieve in order to offset a price increase.
}
\description{
Calculate the average marginal cost reduction necessary to restore
pre-merger prices, or the net Upwards Pricing Pressure in a
two-product merger involving firms playing a
homogeneous product Cournot pricing game.
}
\details{
The \sQuote{shares} vector must have 2 elements, and all \sQuote{shares}
elements must be between 0 and 1. The \sQuote{mktElast} vector must
have 1 non-negative  element.
}
\examples{
shares=c(.05,.65)
industryElast = 1.9


cmcr.cournot(shares,industryElast)


## Calculate the necessary percentage cost reductions for various shares and
##  industry elasticities in a two-product merger where both firm
##  products have identical share (see Froeb and
##  Werden, 1998, pg. 369, Table 1)



deltaHHI = c(100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000) #start with change in HHI
shares = sqrt(deltaHHI/(2*100^2)) #recover shares from change in HHI
industryElast = 1:3

result = matrix(nrow=length(deltaHHI),ncol=length(industryElast),
                dimnames=list(deltaHHI,industryElast))

for(s in 1:length(shares)){
  for(e in 1:length(industryElast)){


    result[s,e] = cmcr.cournot(rep(shares[s],2),industryElast[e])[1]

  }}
