}
\arguments{
\item{capacities}{A length k vector of firm capacities OR capacity shares.}

\item{margins}{A length k vector of product margins. All margins must
be either be between 0 and 1, or NA.}

\item{prices}{A length k vector product prices. Prices may be NA.}

\item{reserve}{A length 1 vector equal to the buyer's reserve
price. Default is NA.}

\item{shareInside}{A length 1 vector equal to the probability that the
buyer does not select the outside option. Default is NA.}

\item{sellerCostCDF}{A length 1 character vector indicating which
probability distribution will be used  to model bidder cost
draws. Possible options are "punif", "pexp", "pweibull", "pgumbel",
"pfrechet". Default is "punif".}

\item{ownerPre}{A length k factor whose values
indicate which firms are present in the market pre-merger.}

\item{ownerPost}{A length k factor whose values
indicate which firms are present in the market post-merger.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length k where each element equals the
proportional change in a firm's capacity  due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' capacity.}

\item{constrain.reserve}{If TRUE, the buyer's post-merger optimal
reserve price is assumed to equal the buyer's pre-merger optimal
reserve price. If FALSE, the buyer re-calculates her optimal reserve
price post-merger.}

\item{parmsStart}{A vector of starting values for calibrated parameters. See below
for more details.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters passed to
the calibration routine optimizer (typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels. Default is "Firm", where
\sQuote{#} is a number between 1 and the length of \sQuote{capacities}.}

\item{...}{Additional options to feed to either \code{\link{optim}} or \code{\link{constrOptim}}.}

\code{auction2nd.cap} returns an instance of class

\description{
Calibrates the parameters of bidder cost distributions and
then simulates the price effect of a merger between two firms
under the assumption that firms are competing in a (Capacity
Constrained) 2nd price auction.

Let k denote the number of firms bidding in the auction below.
}
\details{
\code{auction2nd.cap} examines how a merger affects equilbrium bidding
behavior when a single buyer is running a 2nd price procurement
auction with bidders whose marginal cost of supplying a homogenous product is
private information. This version of the model assumes that
bidders are differentiated by their capacities in the sense that firms
with greater capacity are more likely to have lower costs than firms
with smaller capacities.

Using firm prices, shares, and margins, as well as information
on the auction reserve price as well as the proportion of buyers who
choose not to purchase from any bidder,  \code{auction2nd.cap}
calibrates the parameters of the common distribution from which
bidder's costs are drawn (and, if
not supplied, the implied reserve price) and then uses these calibrated
parameters to calibrate the value to the buyer of selecting the
outside option. Once these parameters have been calibrated,
\code{auction2nd.cap} computes the buyer's optimal pre-merger reservation
price, and if \sQuote{constrain.reserve} is FALSE, computes the buyer's
optimal post-merger reservation price (setting \sQuote{constrain.reserve} to
TRUE sets the buyer's post-merger optimal reserve equal to the buyer's
pre-merger optimal reserve). The pre- and post-merger expected price, conditional on a particular bidder winning, are then calculated.

Currently, the common distribution from which costs may be drawn is
restricted to be either: Uniform ("punif"), Exponential ("pexp"), Weibull
("pweibull"), Gumbel ("pgumbel"), or Frechet ("pfrechet"). Note that
the Exponential is a single parameter distribution, the Uniform and
Weibull are two parameter distributions, and the Gumbel and Frechet
are 3 parameter distributions. Accordingly, sufficient price, margin,
reserve, and outside share information must be supplied in order to
calibrate the parameters of the specified
distribution. \code{auction2nd.cap} returns an error if insufficient
information is supplied.

##Suppose there are 3 firms (A,B,C) participating in a procurement auction with
## an unknown reservation price and that firm A acquires firm B.

caps <- c(0.65,0.30,0.05)           # total capacity normalized to 1 in this example
inShare    <- .67                   # probability that buyer does not select
# any bidder
prices     <- c(3.89, 3.79, 3.74)   # average price charged by each firm
margins    <- c(.228, .209, 0.197)  # average margin earned by each firm
ownerPre   <- ownerPost   <-c("A","B","C")
