equal NA.}

\item{diversions}{A k x k matrix of diversion ratios with diagonal
elements equal to -1. Default is missing.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product pre-merger OR
a k x k matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

indicate which firm produced a product after the merger OR
a k x k matrix of post-merger ownership shares.}

\item{output}{a length 1 logical vector equal to TRUE if merger simulation performed
on output market, FALSE if simulation performed on input market. Default TRUE.}

\item{mktElast}{a negative value indicating market elasticity. Default is NA.}

\item{insideSize}{total revenues included in the market.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length k where each element equals the
proportional change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}

\item{subset}{A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded.Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.}

optimizer used to solve for equilibrium prices.}

\item{parmsStart}{A vector of starting values used to solve for
price coefficient and nest parameters. The first element should
always be the price coefficient and the remaining elements should be
nesting parameters. Theory requires the nesting parameters to be
greater than the price coefficient. If missing then the random
draws with the appropriate restrictions are employed.}

\item{nests}{A length k vector identifying the nest that each
product belongs to.}

\item{constraint}{if TRUE, then the nesting parameters for all
non-singleton nests are assumed equal. If FALSE, then each
non-singleton nest is permitted to have its own value. Default is
TRUE.}

\description{
Calibrates consumer demand using (Nested) Constant Elasticity of
Substitution (CES) and then simulates the price effect of a merger between two firms
under the assumption that all firms in the market are playing a
differentiated products Bertrand pricing game.

Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms playing the
Bertrand pricing game below.
}
\details{
Using product prices, revenue shares and all of the
product margins from at least one firm, \code{ces} is able to
recover the price coefficient and product mean valuations in a
Constant Elasticity of Substitution demand model. \code{ces} then uses these
calibrated parameters to simulate the price effects of a merger between two firms under the
assumption that that all firms in the market are playing a
differentiated products Bertrand pricing game.

\code{ces.alm} is identical to \code{ces} except that it assumes that an outside product exists and uses additional margin information to estimate the share of the outside good.

\code{ces.nests} is identical to \code{ces} except that it includes the \sQuote{nests}
argument which may be used to assign products to different
nests. Nests are useful because they allow for richer substitution
patterns between products. Products within the same nest are assumed
to be closer substitutes than products in different nests. The degree
of substitutability between products located in different nests is
controlled by the value of the nesting parameter sigma.
The nesting parameters for singleton nests (nests containing
                                            only one product) are not identified and normalized to 1.  The vector of
sigmas is calibrated from the prices, revenue shares, and margins supplied
by the user.

By default, all non-singleton nests are assumed to have a common value for sigma.
This constraint may be relaxed  by setting \sQuote{constraint} to
FALSE. In this case, at least one product margin must be supplied from
a product within each nest.

In both  \code{ces} and  \code{ces.nests}, if revenue shares sum to 1,
then one product's mean value is not identified and must be normalized
to 1. \sQuote{normIndex} may be used to specify the index (position) of the
product whose mean value is to be normalized. If the sum of revenue shares
is less than 1, both of these functions assume that the exists a k+1st
product in the market whose price and mean value are both normalized
to 1.
