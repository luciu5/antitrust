}
\arguments{
\item{prices}{A length k vector of product prices.}

\item{shares}{A length k vector of product (quantity) shares. Values must be
between 0 and 1.}

\item{margins}{A length k vector of product margins (in levels, not percents), some of which may
equal NA.}

\item{ownerPre}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product pre-merger OR
a k x k matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{ownerPost}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values
indicate which firm produced a product after the merger OR
a k x k matrix of post-merger ownership shares.}

\item{normIndex}{An integer equalling the index (position) of the
inside product whose mean valuation will be normalized to 1. Default
is 1, unless \sQuote{shares} sum to less than 1, in which case the default is
NA and an outside good is assumed to exist.}

\item{mcDelta}{A vector of length k where each element equals the
(level) change in a product's marginal costs due to
the merger. Default is 0, which assumes that the merger does not
affect any products' marginal cost.}

\item{subset}{A vector of length k where each element equals TRUE if
the product indexed by that element should be included in the
post-merger simulation and FALSE if it should be excluded.Default is a
length k vector of TRUE.}

\item{mcDeltaOutside}{A length 1 vector indicating the change in the marginal cost of the
outside good. Default is 0.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters passed
to the calibration routine optimizer (typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels. Default is "Prod#", where
\sQuote{#} is a number between 1 and the length of \sQuote{prices}.}

\item{mktElast}{a negative value indicating market elasticity. Default is NA.}

\item{insideSize}{An integer equal to total pre-merger units sold.
If shares sum to one, this also equals the size of the market.}

\item{parmsStart}{A length 2 vector of starting values used to solve for
price coefficient and the share of the outside good. The first element should
always be the price coefficient and the second should be
the outside good.}

\item{control.equ}{A list of  \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} control parameters passed
to the non-linear equation solver (typically the \code{calcPrices} method).}

\value{
\code{auction2nd.logit} returns an instance of \code{\linkS4class{Auction2ndLogit}},

\description{
Calibrates consumer demand using Logit and then
simulates the price effect of a merger between two firms
under the assumption that all firms in the market are playing a
differentiated products 2nd score auction game.

Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms playing the
auction game below.
}
\details{
Using product prices, quantity shares and all of the
product margins from at least one firm, \code{auction2nd.logit} is able to
recover the price coefficient and product mean valuations in a
Logit demand model. \code{auction2nd.logit} then uses these
calibrated parameters to simulate a merger between two firms, under the assumption that firms are particpating in a 2nd score procurement auction.

\code{auction2nd.logit.alm} is identical to \code{auction2nd.logit} except that it assumes
that an outside product exists and uses additional margin
information to estimate the share of the outside good.
